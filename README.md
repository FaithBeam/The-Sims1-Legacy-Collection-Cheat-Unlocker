# The-Sims1-Legacy-Collection-Cheat-Unlocker

This unlocks debug mode cheats for The Sims 1 Legacy Collection.

## Requirements

* Steam version of Sims 1 Legacy Collection
  * EA app customers can try this program but start from step 8 in How to Patch

## How to Patch

1. Download [Steamless](https://github.com/atom0s/Steamless)
2. Extract .zip and run Steamless.exe
3. Select Sims.exe to unpack
4. Click Unpack File
5. Close Steamless
6. Optionally rename Sims.exe to Sims.exe.bak
7. Rename Sims.unpacked.exe to Sims.exe so when you run Sims from Steam, it chooses the correct Sims.exe
8. Download the latest Sims1-Legacy-Collection-Debug-Cheat-Unlocker
9. Unzip the archive
10. Run Sims1-Legacy-Collection-Debug-Cheat-Unlocker.exe
11. Select the unpacked Sims.exe which should be Sims.exe at this point
12. Click Patch

### Notes

If the Patch button is grayed out, it means the program could not find the proper data to modify. Make sure you ran 
Steamless beforehand.

## How to Un-Patch

1. Run Sims1-Legacy-Collection-Debug-Cheat-Unlocker.exe
2. Select your Sims.exe
3. Click UnPatch

## Why do I need to run Steamless?

A portion of the Sims.exe provided by Steam is encrypted/packed which makes patching difficult/impossible. Steamless decrypts this 
data and allows for mod authors/hackers to tinker with the executable.

In the future I'll see if I can unpack the Sims.exe myself without Steamless.
